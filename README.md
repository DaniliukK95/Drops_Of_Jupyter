### Topic

- An analysis of the diabetic population and the future impact of living longer 
- Use supervised machine learning to predict who will have diabetic 


#### Background

- According to the US census, we are nearing a point in history where the older population will outnumber of the younger.  
- “By 2034 (previously 2035), there will be 77.0 million (previously 78.0) people 65 years and older compared to 76.5 million (previously 76.7 million) under the age of 18.” 

- The CDC states in its national DIABETES STATISTICS REPORT THAT:
    - 37.3 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE DIABETES (~11% OF the US POPULATION) 
    - 96 MILLION ARE PREDIABETIC (38% OF the ADULT POPULATION) 
    - 26.4 MILLION OF THOSE PREDIABETIC ARE 65 YEARS OR OLDER (~50% OF THE SENIOR POPULATION) 
    - In the last 20 years, diabetes diagnoses have more than doubled.

- Diabetes is:
    - The Leading cause of kidney failure, lower-limb amputations, and adult blindness. 
    - The 7th leading cause of death 

- Problem: 
    - Given the extent that diabetes has affected our country, and its contribution to devastating comorbidities, particularly in the end states, it is concerning that those years of extreme poor health will be extended.
    
    - With the advances in medicine, Americans will live with these chronic conditions for many more years, and with an already strained healthcare system, we will have to prepare for far more dialysis, prosthetics, and resources for the blind due to diabete's direct impact on these health conditions. 
    
    - This will amplify for those in lower socioeconomic communities who studies show are disproportionately affected by diabetes in comparison to those communities of higher education and economic status. 


### Objective

This analysis aims to determine how diabetes data continue to trend in America.  Knowing that communities of lower socioeconomic status are more heavily impacted, we want to see what it will take for those populations to have the resources necessary in preparation for living longer with diabetes. 
 
 
### Description of the data source

- 2021 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
    - link: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/2021nhis.htm

- Table: Sample adult interview
    - Demographics
    - Health status: diabetes
    - Insurance
    - Income


### Questions to address with this study
- What demographic factors are correlated with diabetes?
- Based on these factors, who will likely get diabetes?
