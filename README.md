## Overview
### Topic
Our topic is on diabetes in the United States and the correlation of socioeconmic factors to this disease. 

### Background
_Diabetes_ is a chronic condition that affects the way the body processes blood sugar (glucose). It occurs when the body does not produce enough insulin, or when the body's cells do not properly use the insulin it does produce. Insulin is a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels. If not properly managed, diabetes can lead to serious health complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney damage, blindness, and nerve damage.

Some Statistics:
- Diabetes is a leading cause of death and disability, and it is the seventh leading cause of death globally.
- Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes, accounting for around 90% of all cases (The one you can develop).
- In 2021, an estimated 34.2 million people in the United States, or 10.5% of the population, had diabetes.
- The prevalence of diabetes has been increasing in recent years, with the number of people with the condition increasing by 2 million per year since 2014.
- African Americans, Hispanic/Latino Americans, American Indians, and Alaska Natives have a higher prevalence of diabetes than non-Hispanic whites.

_Socioeconomic factors_ are social and economic conditions that can influence an individual's or group's health, well-being, and access to resources and opportunities. These factors can include things like income, education, occupation, housing, and access to healthcare and social services.

### Objective
This analysis aims to determine how diabetes continues to trend in America.  Knowing that communities of lower socioeconomic status are more heavily impacted, we want to see what it will take for those populations to have the resources necessary in preparation for living longer with diabetes. 

### Questions to address with this study

- What demographic socioeconomic factors are correlated with diabetes?
- Based on these factors, who will likely get diabetes? 
- How successfully can demographics and socioeconomic status predict diabetes?
- Are there any other findings that can be inferred from the analysis?
- What are changes/solutions that can be made to positively impact this issue?


 
### Description of the data sources
- [Data Source: 2021 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/2021nhis.htm)
    - Table: Sample adult interview
        - Demographics
        - Health status: diabetes
        - Insurance
        - Income
    - adult-summary.pdf

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
The team used Jupyter Notebook, Python, Pandas and Numpy to extract, transform the data and load to SQL database. In this process we explored the data with the support of the data Summary and Codebook to translate the coded categorical data. Then using Tableau we visualized the data in a series of pie charts, and graphs. Further analysis was completed using Machine Learning and Logistic Regression. 

### Database Storage
PGAdmin is the database tool we have used. We imported cleaned and transformed CSVs using Pandas and integrated the data into our other analysis tools. PgAdmin4 can also be used to perform analysis. The images below include the ERD, which illustrates the structure of Database. Additionally, we have added an image to depict a join query that joins our tables so a user can compare socia-economic demographics along side an individual's health status.

#### Our Sample Data contains:
  - Over 29,000 observations
  - 3,134 individuals with Diabetes
  - This is just over 10% and comprabable with population estimates. 
  - 45% of our sample is male 
  - 75% White, 11% African American, 6% Asian
  - Average Poverty Ratio is 4 (meaning income is 4 times the national poverty threshold)
  - 39% have attained at least a Bachelor's Degree
  

### Machine Learning
#### Description of preliminary data processing with Machine Learning
- First, all data is imported from the database into the google colab notebook that implements
  the Machine Learning 
- [scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is the machine learning data analysis 
  library we used to create our supervised and unsupervised models.
- Handle categorical attributes with get dummies code

#### Description of data features selection
- Features:  variables in demographics (age, sex, race, education, poverty ratio, and region), diabetic-related health status, general health status, weight and BMI. 
- Target: Diabetes

#### Description of how data is split into training and test set
- Data is split into training and testing sets by using Scikit-learnâ€™s train_test_split function.
- We end up with four sets:  X is split into X_train and X_test sets, and y is split into 
  y_train and y_test sets. 

#### Model 1: Logistic regression 

- We chose logistic regression to measure the feature correlation probability to the target, 
  Diabetes. 
- All variables (except for weight, age, and poverty_ratio) are categorical variables. 
- The target variable only has two possible values, whether a person has been diagnosed with diabetes before or no.  When this classification model encounters new data, it predicts whether the individual would have diabetes.
- Data is pre-processed with [preprocesssing module](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html.).
- Data is split into random training and test subsets with [the model_seletion module](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html).
- Benefit:  logistic regression is relatively simple to execute and understand. 
- Limitation: the accuracies from one or multiple variables are low.  Based on the data 
  visualization below,   linear regression is more suitable.

#### Model 2: Unsupervised Model 

#### Explanation of model choices: Logistic regression 

-	We choose logistic regression to predict diabetes based on socio-economical factors.  
-	All variables (except BMI, age, and income-to-poverty ratio) are categorical. 
-	The target variable only has two possible outcomes, whether a person has diabetes or not.  When this classification model encounters new data, it predicts whether the individual has diabetes.
- Data is pre-processed with [preprocesssing module](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html.).
- Data is split into random training and test subsets with [the model_seletion module](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html).
-	Benefit:  logistic regression is relatively simple to execute and understand. 
- Limitation: the accuracies from one or multiple variables are low.  

We also tried linear regression and unsupervised learning to see if they generated interesting results.
